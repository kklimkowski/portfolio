        Secretly A Decent Artist:
    </u>
            <div class= "more-info-about-being-an-artiist">
              I have been able to draw and sketch since I was about five years old. My grandmother being quit the artist herself made sure that I had a pencil or paint brush in my hands at an early age. Then when I was about twelve years old my parents met a lady who actually taught oil painting and I began taking lessons with her until I was about fifteen. Being an athlete most people tend to be really shocked that I can sketch or paint a picture that looks like it sould be in a gallery somewhere. Of course my mother can not bear to part with any piece of my artwork so to this day my skills have relatively remained a secret.

          Have Never Had Kentucky Fried Chicken:

            <div class= "facts-of-chicken">
            When my mom was a teen she got food poisoning at a Kentucky Fried Chicken and so I have never had this popular franchise. Most people are astonished when I tell them this but I am not a fan of chicken on a bone so I don't really care to eat there anyways. Besides why would I when Chick-Fil-A is clearly a better place to go eat at.

          I Was Born With a Holy Heart....Literally:

            <div class= "holy-heart-description">
              When I was born I had a hole in my heart. However it was not until I was about a year old that it actually caused me any issues. My mother has told me the story because well obviously I don't remember, but it was a typical day when I was on the swings at the park. Then I had a mini seizure and was rushed to the hospital. That''s when they first discovered that my heart had a hole in it. Lukily it healed its self, almost miraculously. Since then I haven't had an other issues with it.

          My First Sport:

            <div class= "detailsaboutmyfirstsport">
              Surprisingly it was not basketball or even running. The first sport I ever played was softball. Let's just say though that didn't last very long. I started the sport in first grade and like the second game in season I got my hand stuck in a helmet while I was wearing it. I wanted to quit right after that game but my mom made me finish the rest of the season.
