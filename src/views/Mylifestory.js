        My Life Story (So Far):
        </div>

        Where do I even start, I mean I guess the only place is the beginning. I was born on July 20th, 2002 at the Stillwater hospital in Oklahoma. I will say I had a pretty normal chiildhood. I spent all of my life in a little town known as Harrah, Oklahoma. While it was a very tiny town I was given the chance to grow up with a strong community background. Everyone knew everybody which can serve as a good thing and yet at times also a bad thing. I attended the same school that my father went to. It's kind of special when you can say that you graduated from the same high school as one of your parents, and let me tell you I loved my high school. It was by no means a grand place, I'm pretty sure the school hasn't changed any since when my father went there, but it is home to me. It helped shape the person that I am today. I will say though come senior year I was ready to get out. That's how I ended up where I am today in Winfield, Kansas. I am getting a bit ahead of myself though. I caan promise you if you had told me my junior year of high school that I was going to be in Kansas I would have laughed at you. You see I was basically raised playing sports and from an early age it became clear to me that I loved basketball. Everything about the sport is amazing to me. I tell everyone I am happiest when I am in a gym shooting hoops or running drills. So when I got a full scholarship to play basketball at Oklahoma Baptist University I jumped on it. The coaches there were like second mothers to me, it was only 30 minutes from my house, and they had a great journalism program. I was set and everything was planned I just needed high school to hurry up so I could begin my life at OBU. Then beginning (there's that word again, it feels like we are always starting from a new beginning doesn't it), but anyways the assistant coach at OBU calls me and tells me that her and the head coach are leaving. while we left on good terms I was heartbroken. It felt like everything was falling apart. However, I am a strong believer that everything happens for a reason, that God has a purpose for all of us and sometimes we just need a little direction to get on the right path. After this I gained several other offers but none felt like Southwestern when I stepped on campus I knew that I had finally found my path. Which leads me to where I am today, continually struggling to balance practices with basketball and track (you know I couldn't just make it easy on myself I had to decide to do two sports instead of one) and classes, spending most of my night drinking probably way too much coffee so I can finish all of my homework, but also just trying to figure out who I am meant to be. It's already been a cray ride so far but I feel as though I am only just beginning what will be a great journey.
